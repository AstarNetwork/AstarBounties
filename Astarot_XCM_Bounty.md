#### Overview
There are not that many UI enhancing tools dedicated to Astar. Astarot is enhancing native polkadotXCM pallet and alows user to transfer native XCM in three different scenarios. This saves time to users and developers also. Astarot do not require specific message route from you, it fills it for you from simple details you are required to provide (way less details than if you were to construct call manually).

Astarot's main advantages can be sumarized into following points:

- You can execute native tasks from simple user friendly interface.
- It is super fast to fill & send transactions you need.
- Your data is never stored or sent anywhere. This project is strictly open source.
