### **Why Polkadot?**

Polkadot is a Substrate-based blockchain that allows the creation of multiple parachains to be connected to the main chain. Substrate is a framework that allows the creation of blockchains using a modular approach. It uses Rust programming language and it is very secure. It is also very fast and scalable. Fees in polkadot are very low and the TPS is very high.

**Astar**

The network supports the building of dApps with EVM and WASM smart contracts and offers developers true interoperability, with cross-consensus messaging (XCM). Astar Network focuses on making the best smart contract platform so that dApps developers on Polkadot do not need to pay much attention to infrastructure and can focus more on their dApp.

### References


This project was originally supported by the Web3 Foundation and the Polkadot team. The project was developed by the BlockCoders team.
As we continue to develop the project, we will continue to support the Astar Network.
We added this new feature to the project, which is the ability to deploy WebAssembly smart contracts on any Substrate-based blockchain.
